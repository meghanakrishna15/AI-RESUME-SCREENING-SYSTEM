AI-Based Resume Screening System

This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening System built using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning.

The application compares resumes with a given job description and calculates a match score using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity. It also supports multiple resume comparison and candidate ranking, simulating a basic Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
